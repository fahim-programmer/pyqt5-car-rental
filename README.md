A project which uses PyQt5, SQLite and Python3 for a Car Rental Application. It is a good model application to learn and implement this project in a different way. 

Hello,

I have included more functions in the backend to easily increase the functionality of this project into something serious.

Also, I recommend installing https://sqlitebrowser.org/ DB browser to able to interact with the database with ease. I used that in my testing.
For car images only .jpgs are supported. So, set this up you have to get Python, download 3.9.5 version for optimal experience and remember to install pip
and Python to the path or you can add these manually later, but it is a time consuming process hence not recommended. After doing this, you have to install Pycharm
and setup a project with a name of your choice. Let it finish and copy two python source files and database into the main directory of that project along with requirements.txt.

After completing this, you have to open terminal in Pycharm and type (venv) DIRECTORY> "pip install requirements.txt". It will download everything needed to run this project.
Sit back and relax, after it finishes, you would be able to run the program via main_frontend.py file. 

Note: This is possible due to PyQt5 and it is an amazing gui toolkit for python. Some fonts might act not right, you can change them easily via .setStyleSheet method of the QWidgets.

Best Regards,
Fahim
